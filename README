Stax XML Parser
---------------
An API on top of the JDK javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamReader. Performs simple and
efficient content extraction similar to XPath but much more efficient in terms
of memory and execution time. 

Element and element text extraction is supported using the PathExpression 
class to provide XPath like capability. Unlike XPath, navigation is forward only.
Also attribute parsing is not currently supported. 

APIs are provided to extract the first node that matches the path expression.
Multiple expressions may be processed in a single pass. 

Example:

Set<PathExpression> expressions = new HashSet<PathExpression>();

Map<PathExpression,Element> results;
PathExpression px0 = new PathExpression("//Order/customerId");
expressions.add(px0);

PathExpression px1 = new PathExpression("//AppInfo/globalTransactionId");
expressions.add(px1);

PathExpression px2 = new PathExpression("//AppInfo/applicationId");
expressions.add(px2);

pathExpressionExtractor = new PathExpressionXMLContentExtractor(expressions);
		
results = 
    (Map<PathExpression,Element>)pathExpressionExtractor
            .extractElements(xml, Element.class);
